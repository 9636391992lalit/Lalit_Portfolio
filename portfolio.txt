💼 Project Title

MERN Stack Professional Portfolio Website (LinkedIn-Style Personal Profile)

🧭 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack personal portfolio web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It serves as a LinkedIn-style professional website that displays your skills, experience, projects, education, and contact information in an interactive and visually appealing format.

The main goal of this project is to replace the need for a LinkedIn profile by creating your own dynamic personal branding platform — one that recruiters can visit to learn everything about your technical background and experience.

The website’s content (projects, experience, and skills) is fetched dynamically from MongoDB, showing your ability to integrate a database-driven backend with a responsive frontend.

🎯 Objectives

To develop a LinkedIn-like professional portfolio using full-stack technologies.

To provide a centralized personal branding hub for showcasing skills and experience.

To demonstrate full MERN stack proficiency (frontend + backend + database).

To allow dynamic data management via MongoDB instead of hardcoded data.

To create a contact form that sends messages and stores them in a database.
